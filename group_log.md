### Keaton - 5/26/2017
- Researched possible database implementations
- Found out that SQLite is integrated into Android Studo
- Wrote code to create a "PLANT" table with: ID, NAME, DESCRIPTION columns as a sample table
- Pushed changes so others can review and discuss if this is a possible database implementation we want to pursue for development.
- Will implement generic CRUD operations for the sample table if this is the implementation we choose.
