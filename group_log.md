---
### Keaton - 5/26/2017
- Researched possible database implementations.
- Found out that SQLite is integrated into Android Studio.
- Wrote code to create a "PLANT" table with: ID, NAME, DESCRIPTION columns as a sample table.
- Pushed changes so others can review and discuss if this is a possible database implementation we want to pursue for development.
- Will implement generic CRUD operations for the sample table if this is the implementation we choose.
---
### Raman - 5/28/2017
- Added dev tasks to issue tracker
- Assigned myself [DT3-I1](https://github.com/Raman-Maan/plantr/issues/3)
- Added project consistent coding standards to git for easier control
- Got a basic CLI working using the sample project as a guide
- Created a Plant object holding the information required for [DT3-I1](https://github.com/Raman-Maan/plantr/issues/3) and [DT4-I1](https://github.com/Raman-Maan/plantr/issues/4)
- Added a temperature object - need to discuss where we'll keep "helper" classes
- Created a Database interface and an empty database stub for this iteration
---
### Group Discussion - 5/30/2017
- Discussed architecture of project.
- Heavy DB work for next iteration (lots of functionality depends on the DB).
- Three-point scale for plant difficulty based on How hardy it is, how long it can go without water, if it needs any other care, etc.
- GUI design discussed.
- Iteration focus discussed.
- Everyone claimed an issue.
- We identified our workflow:
  - iteration will be the branch with all the information of our current iteration. 
  - We do feature branches off Iteration and do dev work in those
  - When complete we merge iteration into our branch and conduct a CR through slack
  - After an changes need to be made we merge our feature branch into Iteration
  - Any bugfixes go directly into Iteration
  - Once the iteration is complete we merge it into master
---
### Keaton - 5/31/2017
- Added a stub database class to perform basic creation of plants as JSONObjects to be used as test data.
- Added a stub database interface to allow abstraction from implementation details.
- Created a stub database test class that tests the current methods in the stub database.
- Added testCompile 'org.json:json:20140107' to build.gradle file to allow JSON objects within Unit Tests.
---
### Keaton - 6/01/2017
- Refactored stub database functions with more accurate sample test data so they can be used more robustly throughout development
- Refactored stub database tests to model these changes
- Created a class and interface for the "PlantLookup" page of the application
- Implemented a function to lookup a plant by name from the stub database
- Created a PlantLookupTest class to test current and future functions in the PlantLookup class
- Created a "Constants" class under application for constants that will be used across the entire applcation
- Reviewed current Iteration branch and removed code that would be replaced by the newly added changes for the StubDatabase
- Reworked current StubDatabase functions to use ArrayLists to store records
- Reworked tests for the StubDatabase functions to use ArrayLists
- Implemented a Singleton pattern for the database
---
### Group Discussion - 6/04/2017
- Discussed project state
- Stub database overhaul
- Discussed requirements + implementation of GUI for plant view
- Distributed remaining high priority tasks
---
### Raman - 6/04/2017
- Completed [DT3-I1](https://github.com/Raman-Maan/plantr/issues/3)
  - Waiting on Kevin to complete GUI portion
- Added an AllTests.java file to organize tests
- Code reviewed #16
---
### Keaton - 6/06/2017
- Revised all PlantLookup Class / Interface functions to use different code structure (ArrayLists)
- Refactored build.gradle file since we will not be using JSONObjects

---
### Michael - 06/06/2017
- Created a Difficulty class that represents how difficult it is to take care of a Plant
- Finished [DT5-I1](https://github.com/Raman-Maan/plantr/issues/5)
---
### Raman - 06/06/2017
- Re-added the database service manager

---
### Kevin - 06/07/2017
- Implemented simple GUI for displaying plant information
- Implemented list view for all the plants in the stub db
---
### Raman - 06/07/2017
- Refactored difficulty algorithm handling so it's not an object, rather it's an alogorithm that assigns a plant a difficulty
- Added to the Difficulty Tests range

  - Added the missing UI elements
- Refactored code to enforce project code styling

---
### Michael -Â  06/07/2017

### Austin - 06/07/2017

---
### Group Discussion - 06/25/17
- Discussed user stories and developer tasks
- Designed paper prototype for basic UI and user navigation
- Assigned developer tasks
---
### Raman - 07/06/2017
- Big overhaul in HSQLDB, correcting silly mistakes, got it up and running
- Added an alternative way of calling the stub to make running unit tests easier
- Added support for personal plants to be added to the garden

---
### Raman - 07/07/2017
- Completed testing of HSQLDB - opened pull request
- Updated Github project - Iteration 2, moved over stories, closed milestone, cleaned up and organized columns
---
### Raman - 07/08/2017
- Continuing work on user based stories, doing all user related dev tasks in one branch instead of iteration because of tight coupling of dev tasks
- Added plant watering tracking to database
---
### Raman - 07/09/2017
- Added user support to database
- Added a login screen
    - moved initial database configuration tasks from MainActivity to LoginActivity
- Fixed plants not being added to garden correctly
- Personal plants now keep track of their owner, and each user can only view plants that they own
- Slight changes to HSQLDB(prepared statements) to handle new users, leaving other methods untouched due to time constraints
- Corrected failing tests
- Updating stub to behave as expected
---
### Group Meeting - 07/09/17

- Discussed the presentation for the course
---
### Raman - 07/10/2017
- Merged user details

---
### Raman - 07/11/2017
- Cleaned up project a little more, man I hate Github Projects, should have used Trello :cry:
- Fixed some defects that got missed in the testing: #81, #82
- Refactored some business logic out of presentation layer and into business layer
